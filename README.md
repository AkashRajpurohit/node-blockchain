# Blockchain App using Node.js

## Things I've learned while building this
* Building the blockchain class with its required functionality.
* Accessing the blockchain with express API.
* Creating a decentralized blockchain network.
* Synchronizing the entire network.
* Create Consensus.
* Building Block Explorer (UI tool to view blockchain data) etc..

## Running the APP locally

### Prerequisites
1. NodeJS:
Please install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 10.15.0. If you already have it, you're good to go.

2. Yarn:
Visit Yarn [download page](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). Select your Operating system and follow the instructions.

Once you have the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) covered:

1. Clone this repository from GitHub onto your local computer.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AkashRajpurohit/node-blockchain.git
```

2. Navigate into the project folder and install all of its necessary dependencies with Yarn.

```
cd node-blockchain
yarn install
```
3. Start the server
```sh
yarn start
```

> This will start the decentralized network on ports 3001 - 3006. Visit each node at these urls.

* [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/)
* [http://localhost:3002/](http://localhost:3002/)
* [http://localhost:3003/](http://localhost:3003/)
* [http://localhost:3004/](http://localhost:3004/)
* [http://localhost:3005/](http://localhost:3005/)
* [http://localhost:3006/](http://localhost:3006/)
